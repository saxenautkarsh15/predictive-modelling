# predictive-modelling
The code is compiled in R
The attached code contains a model formed on the basis of random forest since the data is a bit categorical and a tree model can easily be visualised as well as it provides more accuracy.
After forming a tree model we see that the tree has 3 branches so it would be suitable to form a random forest which may further increase the accuracy
The final result obtained is 100 % accuracy which is a very rare occurence.
